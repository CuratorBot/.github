## About Us 🙋🏻‍♀️

> Curator is a feature rich and easy to use temporary channel bot that will create temporary voice and text channels
> that can be customized by the channel owners without restrictions!
> Getting started is as easy as simply joining one of Curator's Join to create Voice channels and you're good to go!



## Main Features 😎

- **Private and Clean** - Text channels are hidden to all members except the admins and the channel owner which promotes server cleanliness. The text channel only appears if the user is inside the VC and disappears again once the user leaves.
- **Simple** - Once the Voice and Text channel is created, Curator would send a nice embed informing the channel owner some useful commands that he can do to fully customize his channel. What's cool about it is, the settings the owner sets gets saved and would apply these settings if he makes another channel!
- **Free** - Yes, you read it right! Curator is **FREE** for everyone! So what are you waiting for? Invite Curator now!

## FAQs ❓

1. Why won't the channel delete when its empty?
   > This is because of missing permissions. Make sure the Curator's Role is at the top of the role list and has the Administrator permission in order to fix the problem. Another solution is to re-invite the bot by typing `/invite`. This would reset/re-apply Curator's role with a fresh set of permissions.
1. How do I setup clone channels?
   > You can setup clone channels by simply typing `/setup clone`. This would create a clone channel category and a VC at the very bottom of the server. The clone channel's category would be automatically selected for the `/clone` manager.
1. How do I use `/clone`?
   > `/clone` is the manager for the clone channels. You use this to create, and delete channels in the clone channel category. To add channels, you need to select the category you wish to edit. To do this, type `/select`, followed by a space, then add the ID of the category you wish to edit. Once selected, you can now freely do `/clone add` to add channels. You can optionally put a name after `/clone add` to specify a name for this new channel. To remove a channel, assuming the channel is already selected, type `/clone remove`, followed by a space, then the id of the channel you wish to delete. You can also normally delete the channel by right-clicking it and pressing delete.
